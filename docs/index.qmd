::: {.callout-warning} 
quartodoc is work in progress! For a basic implementation, take a look at the [docs folder](https://github.com/machow/quartodoc/tree/main/docs) for this site,
including [this script](https://github.com/machow/quartodoc/blob/main/docs/1_generate_api.py) used to generate API pages.
:::

For users:

* Read and interact with docstrings.
* Render them to markdown or html.
* Crosslink to generated documentation.

For developers:

* Easy to extend / create new renderers.
* Simple: each step of the process is explained in detail, so you can use a single
  part (e.g. render a docstring to markdown) if you want.
