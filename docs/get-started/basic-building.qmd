**tl;dr**: Once you've configured quartodoc in your `_quarto.yml` file, use the following commands to build and preview a documentation site.

```bash
# Create the documentation files. These are written 
# by default to the reference/ folder in your docs.
quartodoc build --verbose

# Create optional inventory files, which allow you to
# link to API doc pages within and across documentation
# sites. These are put in the _inv folder in your docs.
quartodoc interlinks

# Preview the documentation site.
# Use quarto render to generate the final site.
quarto preview
```

## Rebuilding doc pages

```bash
quartodoc build --verbose
```
