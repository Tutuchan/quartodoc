## Goals

* Load docstrings (with [griffe](https://github.com/mkdocstrings/griffe))
* Render docstrings (e.g. with [MdRenderer](/api/#sec-MdRenderer))
* Enable cross references to function documentation.
  - Link to functions within a doc.
  - Link to functions in other docs.
  - Generate an inventory file for other docs to link to yours.
* (WIP) Generate high-level summaries.
  - Class summaries, with methods.
  - Tables of function names and descriptions.

## Different documentation structures

* All functions listed on a single page.
* Functions split across a few pages (e.g. parsers, renderers).
* Each function gets its own page.
