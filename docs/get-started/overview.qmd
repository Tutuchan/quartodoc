::: {.callout-warning} 
quartodoc is work in progress! For a basic implementation, take a look at the [docs folder](https://github.com/machow/quartodoc/tree/main/docs) for this site,
including [this script](https://github.com/machow/quartodoc/blob/main/docs/1_generate_api.py) used to generate API pages.
:::

Coming soon!

## Goals

* Load docstrings (with [griffe](https://github.com/mkdocstrings/griffe))
* Render docstrings (e.g. with [MdRenderer](/api/#sec-MdRenderer))
* Enable cross references to function documentation.
  - Link to functions within a doc.
  - Link to functions in other docs.
  - Generate an inventory file for other docs to link to yours.
* (WIP) Generate high-level summaries.
  - Class summaries, with methods.
  - Tables of function names and descriptions.

## Different documentation structures

* All functions listed on a single page.
* Functions split across a few pages (e.g. parsers, renderers).
* Each function gets its own page.
