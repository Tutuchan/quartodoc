quartodoc is work in progress!
:::

quartodoc let's you quickly generate python package documentation,
using markdown and quarto. It is designed as an alternative to sphinx.

## Installation

```bash
python -m pip install quartodoc

# or from github
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/machow/quartodoc.git
```

## Basic use

```yaml
project:
  type: website
  resources:
    - objects.json

quartodoc:
  style: single-page
  dir: reference
  package: quartodoc
  sections:
    - title: Some functions
      desc: These functions inspect and parse docstrings.
      contents:
        - get_object
        - preview
```

## Goals

* Load docstrings (with [griffe](https://github.com/mkdocstrings/griffe))
* Render docstrings (e.g. with [MdRenderer](/api/#sec-MdRenderer))
* Enable cross references to function documentation.
  - Link to functions within a doc.
  - Link to functions in other docs.
  - Generate an inventory file for other docs to link to yours.
* (WIP) Generate high-level summaries.
  - Class summaries, with methods.
  - Tables of function names and descriptions.

## Different documentation structures

* All functions listed on a single page.
* Functions split across a few pages (e.g. parsers, renderers).
* Each function gets its own page.
